# Train-Tracker

It is **a game with 20 * 20 board**.

A train, with engine '#' starts to reach target mentioned as 'T'.
It picks up passengers, and a compartment '*' gets added.
Then, another target is set, and train has to reach. Likewise, game proceeds.
If the train moves out of the border, the game is over. 
For movements, standard WASD keys are used.

It has five levels, each level speed increases (i.e, _sleep() less_).
In addition, it has Instructions and High Score page.

This program is developed during my 2nd Year BE and took a lot of thoughts for almost six months from start to finish.
The main code to change the direction of the train took 4 months.
Only after development of the game, while playing, I realized it looks similar to Snake game in Nokia mobiles.
It could be played only in _Turbo C_. Since, a lot of conio functions specifically available in Turbo C are used.

If you have time, just install Turbo C, and run this game.
Share how it looks.
